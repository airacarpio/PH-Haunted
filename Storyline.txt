Storyline
	One of the haunted houses found in the Philippines is Laperal White House, that specifically located in Baguio City. Just like other haunted houses, it remains uninhabited except for the caretaker who lives outside the house within the gates. The tragic story happened when the Laperal family, the oldest clan in Baguio, was brutally murdered inside the house by the Spanish soldiers. The Laperal White House is full of history and unshared stories. Some says that once you enter the house, there is no way to go out.
	One night, a guy who loves to travel and explore new things, makes a documentary about the different places in the Philippines. Out of curiosity, he entered the Laperal house. Little did he know that according to the story no one can escape once they enter the house. The guy was locked inside the haunted house and the only way he can possibly escape is by finding the key while avoiding all the ghost.
